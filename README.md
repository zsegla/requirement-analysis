# 📝 Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 📌 Introduction
This repository documents the Requirement Analysis phase for a **Hotel Booking Management System**. It simulates a real-world project where software requirements are analyzed, structured, and visually represented to guide developers and stakeholders toward successful implementation.

---

## 🔍 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying and defining what a system should do. It involves gathering input from stakeholders and turning it into actionable, validated requirements.

In the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**, it serves as the foundation for design, development, and testing. Without proper requirement analysis, projects risk miscommunication, delays, or failure.

## 💡 Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. ✅ **Ensures Clarity Among Stakeholders**  
   Everyone shares the same expectations and understanding of the system.

2. ⚠️ **Reduces Risk and Cost**  
   Prevents unnecessary rework and ensures timely delivery.

3. 🧪 **Guides Development and Testing**  
   Helps developers and testers work with confidence and direction.
